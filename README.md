Bomberman is a robot engaged in the production of bombs. Like his fellow
robots, he had been put to work in an underground compound by evil
forces. Bomberman found it to be an unbearably dreary existence. One
day, he heard an encouraging rumor. According to the rumor, any robot
that could escape the underground compound and make it to the surface
could become human. Bomberman leaped at the opportunity, but escape
proved to be no small task. Alerted to Bomberman's betrayal, large
numbers of the enemy set out in pursuit. Bomberman can rely on bombs of
his own production for his defense. Will he ever make it up to the
surface? Once there, will he really become human?
